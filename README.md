# Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive exploration of financial data analysis and visualization techniques. It incorporates a variety of Python libraries to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data effectively. The notebook is structured to guide users through the process of data preparation, analysis, and the application of statistical models.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**: Utilizes MetaTrader 5 integration for fetching financial data, followed by cleaning, standardization, and normalization to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Demonstrates the use of histograms, pair plots, and distribution plots to explore data characteristics and relationships.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employs statistical tools to analyze the normality of data distributions and to fit models for predictive analysis.

## Libraries Used
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- MetaTrader 5
- DateTime
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels
- Seaborn
